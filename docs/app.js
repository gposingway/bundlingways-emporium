After lots of tweaking with Reshade, I found the perfect balance for me - it fixes the faded colors while preserving the feel of the game. In my opinion, it took my game from beautiful to absolutely stunning.\r\n\r\nThis was created with Reshade 3.0.6 and works with 3.3.2. Install from reshade.me, drop my preset into your install folder (it should be in the same place as your .exe), launch the game, press Shift+F2 to open the overlay, toddle through the introduction tutorial, and then select the preset with the dropdown box at the top. Once you are happy with your settings, click over to the Settings tab of Reshade and enable Performance Mode.\r\nIf you need help or are having issues, please PM me on reddit - /u/nightmarecandle.\r\n\r\nMy other preset: ☾ Shadowsong - For Screenshots/Portraits for Final Fantasy XIV ARR.\r\n\r\nEnabled shaders: Colourfulness, Curves, HDR, LumaSharpen, Tonemap, &amp; Vibrance\r\n\r\nGamma: My gamma in all pre-SB (Hostelry image) screenshots is 59. After, it is 39. However, gamma is going to vary greatly depending on your monitor; this preset does not darken/brighten the game enough to be an issue.\r\n\r\nISSUE NOTICE: Some people have reported issues with HDR/FakeHDR.fx.

It is not over-saturated....ok it&#39;s a little saturated lol, but it is a lot clearer, crisp and has more effects. If you&#39;re playing with this on during gameplay i would recommend a 690 or higher!. Or just disable SSAO.\r\n\r\nAlso note that SSAO is not perfect in reshade, at least not my settings. You will need to use HBAO if you want perfect AO, this of course gives a much bigger performance hit but a 690 and up should be able to handle it :).\r\n\r\nIf you notice strange graphical artifacts that is SSAO being a pest, don&#39;t worry about it. Disable SSAO or use HBAO and you will be good to go!.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve basically tweaked every single setting to almost perfection, well perfection in reference to my own tastes. So as a default, a setting may be too strong or not show up at all. But i messed around with everything to give slight visual effects which provides a good foundation for further tweaking :).\r\n\r\nThe position and angle of DoF will vary from character to character, mine is 0.5 because it matches up with the center of my screen and the specific height of my own character.\r\n\r\nDepth of field may flicker on and off at certain times as the depth buffer is still in beta and is out of my hands. It may be fixed in the recent updates for reshade but i&#39;ve heard problems with the newest version working with XIV.\r\n\r\nAdded bloom properly and tweaked it to only show up under certain brightness conditions, SSAO, a more accurate SMAA, tweaked filmgrain, godrays, extremely slight lens flare with tweaks, and changed the DoF up, reduced saturation a bit in HDR and bokeh, thinking about adding a tonemap not sure. \r\n\r\nNote this only works with DX11!.

it.\r\nTook me a couple hours of work to make it to my own liking, but it&#39;s not without it&#39;s issues.\r\nThe torches/fire are bit too darkish red/orange like wich i think looks unnatural but it is what it is...\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s still WIP, i constantly change it to perfect it more, as seen in the screenshots it looks like there&#39;s a red tint to it.\r\nTbh in-game i don&#39;t notice it as much, but i will keep working on that.\r\n\r\nEffects used:\r\n\r\nMagicBloom\r\nColourfullness\r\nCurves\r\nDPX\r\nLevels\r\nLiftGammaGain\r\nSepia\r\nTechnicolor2\r\nVibrance\r\n\r\nNotes: If the colors are oversaturated disable Colourfulness.\r\n\r\nMy GPU is a 780 Ti Matrix 3GB, it consumes about 10-15fps on my rig.\r\nDisabling MagicBloom helps a bit, i gain around 5-7fps with it off.\r\n\r\nI will add more screenshots later, i&#39;m playing on a new trial account through

It&#39;s been heavily tweaked to work both day and night and in as many different lightings as I could think of, and will probably be further modified in the future.\r\nI set the MXAO to be similar in power to Stormshade&#39;s, and modified the colors/contrast to my tastes. If your tastes are similar, great! If they aren&#39;t quite, turn something off or modify it.\r\n\r\nThis was created with Reshade 3.1.1. First time users: Install from reshade.me, drop my preset into your install folder (it should be in the same place as your .exe), launch the game, press Shift+F2 to open the overlay, toddle through the introduction tutorial, and then select the preset with the dropdown box at the top. Once you are happy with your settings, click over to the Settings tab of Reshade and enable Performance Mode.\r\nIf you need help or are having issues, please PM me on reddit - /u/nightmarecandle.\r\n\r\nThis is not a preset you can leave on; effects like MXAO and Depth of Field will heavily alter your UI, and make them impossible or ugly to use.\r\n\r\nFor an always-on play preset, you can try my ☼ No More Washed Out Colors for Final Fantasy XIV ARR.\r\n\r\nEnabled shaders: Colourfulness, Levels, Tonemap, Vibrance, MXAO, DPX, Clarity, HDR (FakeHDR), AdaptiveFog, AmbientLight, AdaptiveSharpen, Bloom, MartyMcFlyDOF, SMAA.\r\n\r\nDPX shader customization: This shader is highly customizable and, in my opinion, adds a lot of beauty to screenshots. However, in certain situations it can blow out certain colors. You can either turn it off, or adjust the strength or RGB settings when necessary; I do the latter. I have attempted to set them to a &quot;neutral&quot; setting, leaning a bit towards red, for this preset. I need to adjust the yellows a bit; I got it to look nice everywhere EXCEPT Gyr Abania, where it turns bright mustard yellow during the day.","PackageType":"Preset","AlternateTitle":null,"PackageAlias":null,"Source":"sfx.thelazy.net","Timestamp":"2025-03-27T22:41:50.891+00:00","Skipped":false,"Imported":true,"Published":true,"Tags":null,"URLs":{"IterativeDownload":null,"OriginalDownloadLink":"https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/8911/download/","Page":"https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/8911/","DirectDownload":"https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/8911/download/"}},{"Id":"preset-5193088c11a4677c5e0a13544c5470eaa582f7022f497dfc3fca59aecc1267e31ea0cdc671915bbc5d1e6473a2a15b378df03b0ae28a2b83ac698d24b1511364","Name":"ExileCG - ReShade Presets","Author":"CygnusExul","Description":"","PackageType":"Preset","AlternateTitle":null,"PackageAlias":null,"Source":"aetherlink.app","Timestamp":"2025-03-27T22:41:50.898+00:00","Skipped":false,"Imported":true,"Published":true,"Tags":null,"URLs":{"IterativeDownload":null,"OriginalDownloadLink":"https://cdn.aetherlink.app/7028812635579908096/7028839391112232960/7028839865861308416.zip","Page":"https://aetherlink.app/mods/7028839391112232960","DirectDownload":"https://cdn.aetherlink.app/7028812635579908096/7028839391112232960/7028839865861308416.zip"}},{"Id":"preset-368a1684b54b95c5f723745cfb54fe6f08951eeb4f52a8e7ff2e5f0518b1761f3cb7c75453af66b8736041b9e5e413ed0e86f1c38cdca701ff4278e43b55125d","Name":"Siren&#39;s Bright and Crisp Reshade v3.0.8","Author":"SirenBrink","Description":"This preset is very bloomy and colored mostly blue for a very fantasy look.\r\n\r\nAdjust to taste.","PackageType":"Preset","AlternateTitle":null,"PackageAlias":null,"Source":"sfx.thelazy.net","Timestamp":"2025-03-27T22:41:51.076+00:00","Skipped":false,"Imported":true,"Published":true,"Tags":null,"URLs":{"IterativeDownload":null,"OriginalDownloadLink":"https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/8618/download/","Page":"https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/8618/","DirectDownload":"https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/8618/download/"}},{"Id":"preset-fec04a65680c2a5d7e4cd85d4cf85d2ff1f1c14f0c01f41df3d7035e5a756133fb11fc7c3e16542bb246ea0f64f0a53c55a88a5f9455dcf512ca085e05a75c40","Name":"❈ FILM《 Afterglow Studios Preset Collection 》","Author":" Afterglow Studios","Description":"","PackageType":"Preset","AlternateTitle":"Download","PackageAlias":null,"Source":"aetherlink.app","Timestamp":"2025-03-27T22:41:51.142+00:00","Skipped":false,"Imported":true,"Published":true,"Tags":null,"URLs":{"IterativeDownload":"https://ko-fi.com/s/2cb4eae047","OriginalDownloadLink":"https://ko-fi.com/s/2cb4eae047","Page":"https://aetherlink.app/mods/7011896349943955456","DirectDownload":null}},{"Id":"preset-d45c636a6fa0f09e6f46870c47c98468db0bd29f0ad92f069e050833b25e56fed43ad28e90aae525482182afdbfc819f2e6eb310af7e2658a67f85f048b8ceff","Name":"SR ReShade FFXIV HW","Author":"sarasta","Description":"ReShade/SweetFX preset for FFXIV HW (DirectX 11)\r\n\r\n-Natural saturation and contrast\r\n-Sharp lines, smooth skin\r\n-Comfortable gameplay (Clear UI, 3-5 fps cost for me without DoF)\r\n\r\nInstall Instruction\r\n*Skip step 1～5 if you already use ReShade+Framework.\r\n*Also skip 3～4 if you could run ReShade 0.19.0 or higher version properly.

that you see in the screenshots, as a .txt file. open up your SweetFX_settings.cfg (inside your game/ReShade folder) with a simple text editor like notepad++, replace the text with mine, and hit save.\r\n\r\n3) OPTIONAL Depth of Field (DoF) and UI mask instructions follow.\r\n\r\n2023 update: there are shaders which can mask UI much more easily than this without custom maps. theoretically this would still work though so I&#39;ll leave it for posterity\r\n\r\nwhen you&#39;re opening all these different files, make sure when you save it that it is still the original file type and not a newly minted .txt file (if you just use &#39;save&#39; you shouldn&#39;t have any issue)\r\n\r\n***to use DoF, open your McFX_settings.cfg file and set &quot;#define USE_DEPTHOFFIELD&quot; to 1. iirc, the default key to toggle it is F11, which you can also change here.\r\n\r\n***to change DoF to off by default (toggle key still works), open DOF.h and find\r\ntechnique DoF_Tech &lt;bool enabled = RFX_Start_Enabled; ... &gt;\r\nand change it to\r\ntechnique DoF_Tech &lt;bool enabled = false; ... &gt;\r\n***to enable a UI mask for DoF and anti-aliasing (i.e. make at least your static UI elements actually readable) open Common_settings.cfg and set &quot;#define RFX_UIMask&quot; to 1\r\n\r\nthen find &quot;#define RFX_UIMask_Direct&quot; and make sure it is set to 0\r\n\r\nit is now attempting to use the image &quot;ReShade/Common/Textures/RFX_uiMask.png&quot; to mask most ReShade effects. you&#39;ll probably want to change this image to something that makes a little more sense. here&#39;s mine:\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lCHjYBf.png\r\n\r\nsave this image as RFX_uiMask.png and place it in the ReShade/Common/Textures folder. depending on your own ui settings it might look bad. fortunately it&#39;s easy to alter since it&#39;s just black on white image, just draw white where you want to see the effects and black where you don&#39;t.\r\n\r\nthis also masks stuff like color changes, which can look pretty strange. so,\r\n\r\n***to change what the UI mask is masking, you need to move it in the load order, so open ReShade.fx and switch things around based on your own preferences:\r\n\r\nEFFECT(Common, UIMask) will mask all things placed BEFORE it, and ignore all things placed AFTER it\r\nEFFECT(SweetFX, Shared) is where most of my color changes are, so I keep that AFTER\r\nEFFECT(McFX, DOF) is the DoF so I keep that BEFORE, along with EFFECT(SweetFX, SMAAWrap) and EFFECT(SweetFx, FXAAWrap) because I&#39;m mostly sure those are the anti-aliasing things and that also messes with text a bit.\r\n\r\n***to add a toggle key to the UI Mask, open UIMask.h and find\r\n#if RFX_UIMask_Direct\r\ntechnique UIMask_Tech &lt;bool enabled = RFX_Start_Enabled; int toggle = RFX_ToggleKey; &gt;\r\n{\r\n#else \r\ntechnique UIMask_Tech &lt;bool enabled = RFX_Start_Enabled; int toggle = RFX_UIMask_HelperKey; &gt;\r\nand change it to\r\n#if RFX_UIMask_Helper\r\ntechnique UIMask_Tech &lt;bool enabled = RFX_Start_Enabled;

This is the first preset I&#x27;ve made and I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and share it. There are many amazing presets out there, but none felt &quot;just right&quot;; I found many to be either too saturated, too blurry or with way too much bloom added. My aim was to give the game a more sharp, vibrant and cinematic look while still staying true to the original. I tried my best to make it adapt well to all environments while making colors, lighting and details pop. (I also have very sensitive eyes so I tried to keep things from being overly bright &amp; exposed... but there&#x27;s no hope for Limsa.)-This preset includes an optional ADOF and Border that can be toggled off and on if you wish via keybinds; the DoF isn&#x27;t entirely cinematic nor UI friendly so I&#x27;d recommend it only for screenshots. There is also a second more subtle DoF meant to add a natural blur to the distance. If you don&#x27;t like this, this can also be toggled off via DepthSharpenconstDof.-This is a heavy duty preset, meant for higher end PCs. However, feel free to still try it out; I&#x27;d suggest first turning off SSAO if framerate is an issue, as it tends to chunk fps severely. Bloom can also be turned off for a few extra frames.Feel free to tweak it further as things such as saturation and gamma may vary monitor to monitor and I don&#x27;t expect it to be perfect by any means. I recommend using Lightroom for this.To install, simply extract the .ini to your gshade-presets folder. P.S I also suggest downloading Kartoffels&#x27; upscales for an even prettier game. ;)---------------------------------------More photos/comparisons can be found at:https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy14/mods/1597?tab=imagesMake sure Gshade is installed and up to date before using this preset!  https://gposers.com/gshade/","PackageType":"Preset","AlternateTitle":null,"PackageAlias":null,"Source":"xivmodarchive.com","Timestamp":"2025-03-27T22:42:30.656+00:00","Skipped":false,"Imported":true,"Published":true,"Tags":null,"URLs":{"IterativeDownload":null,"OriginalDownloadLink":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/40b596f4-c589-46f3-a298-51babfb270e3/files/Nei_EpicGameplay.ini","Page":"https://xivmodarchive.com/modid/49227","DirectDownload":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/40b596f4-c589-46f3-a298-51babfb270e3/files/Nei_EpicGameplay.ini"}},{"Id":"preset-1c29992721d07c4ccf637ca9bf65625489815cab1f3e40a0fb7333b2978f36aa89df0f0de498a5d1bf40622dc5482bd6db6f8f8a5e66dbfabc2c6f2975755f54","Name":"[Nyeps] Cyber Cherry Collection | ReShade 5.6.0","Author":"𝗛𝗢𝗪𝗟  狼に。","Description":"requires some of GShades old shaders, such as the MXAO + TRON shaderdont forget about the How To Move To ReShade From GShade guide","PackageType":"Preset","AlternateTitle":null,"PackageAlias":null,"Source":"xivmodarchive.com","Timestamp":"2025-03-27T22:42:31.918+00:00","Skipped":false,"Imported":true,"Published":true,"Tags":null,"URLs":{"IterativeDownload":null,"OriginalDownloadLink":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/5c87f269-feb3-465f-aa4d-125b933a7035/files/Nyeps%20Cyber%20Cherry%20FFXIV%20-%20Reshade%205.6.0.zip","Page":"https://xivmodarchive.com/modid/58801","DirectDownload":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/5c87f269-feb3-465f-aa4d-125b933a7035/files/Nyeps%20Cyber%20Cherry%20FFXIV%20-%20Reshade%205.6.0.zip"}},{"Id":"preset-497a8d18cc87b5372044ea52a3a0b88ad29a15b59ee2b468ff85111136a8fa129a311941ccb80856d25f687c4dd6babcdec1df0010d2e42d18508c54b9e21bec","Name":"Mistress Maria&#39;s Go To Preset","Author":"altmommygaymergorl","Description":"Based out of the Fairy Mad World Preset on GshaderGpose taken is my own.Nanokini and Gothic Aura Tats used in this shot.","PackageType":"Preset","AlternateTitle":null,"PackageAlias":null,"Source":"xivmodarchive.com","Timestamp":"2025-03-27T22:42:33.706+00:00","Skipped":false,"Imported":true,"Published":true,"Tags":null,"URLs":{"IterativeDownload":null,"OriginalDownloadLink":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/c8e4c539-5d0f-4b04-bba7-ad847c8b6a61/files/MAD%20WORLD%20GO%20TO.ini","Page":"https://xivmodarchive.com/modid/40270","DirectDownload":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/c8e4c539-5d0f-4b04-bba7-ad847c8b6a61/files/MAD%20WORLD%20GO%20TO.ini"}},{"Id":"preset-66e0bb0085cb55e86c344c05dc1e9d0a4d1d16e0a86cdfcc192974c8f548c38ee9d6b1efa768b14a43be6153b2c0e054601da16b1dc238e2a3a02e5e0ab1ee32","Name":"SOFTGLOW ✮⋆˙ [Shader Presets DT]","Author":"Hana","Description":"𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻GShade/ReShade Preset BundleBundle of three portrait shaders with natural colors.I made minor adjustments for Dawntrail but I kept the shaders pretty much the same as before.

I&#x27;ve really worked to try to make sure these aren&#x27;t overblown in bright areas and super crushed in dark areas, and included performance, standard, and screenshot versions for each tone. These are the presets I use for gameplay and as a base for all my screenshots.Please check out all the preview images! I&#x27;ve taken shots in some of the brightest, darkest, and most colourful places I could think of to showcase the range, and provided comparisons on both light and dark skin tones. The preview pics include the location, weather, and tone used for the screenshot.PERFORMANCE NOTES:- Lovingly tested by a wonderful friend running a 6700k &amp; GTX 1070. I tried to keep the performance versions as minimal as possible. I also tried to keep them as visually similar to the standard version as possible. If anyone out there is trying to run reshade on a microwave please let me know if the performance versions tank your fps superbad. USAGE NOTES:- This does not include ffxiv_keeupui! You should be using Reshade Effect Shader Toggler (REST) instead! But if you don&#x27;t want to use REST, just toggle keepui on it&#x27;s fine. if you want to use REST (nudge nudge), check it out here:- - - Reshade Effect Shader Toggler: https://github.com/4lex4nder/ReshadeEffectShaderToggler- - - REST FFXIV Preset (with included shader pack): https://github.com/4lex4nder/ReshadeEffectShaderToggler-FFXIV- I didn&#x27;t include any shaders with this preset pack, only a custom LUT texture I made.

Some are similar like the others. I&#x27;ve intentionally made them like that to add some different details on each preset, like different type of dof and make one sharper/ softer than the other just to give you more choice.Some of them look better at certain time/ weather/ place so I encourage you to play around with it. Please note that the preset called &#x27;tea&#x27; was made specifically for night time use so it will looks not good during the day time/ in the bright place.Theres also 4 FPS friendly gameplay presets that can beautify your game for your daily gameplay needs.These shaders are made on Gshade but if you&#x27;ve moved from Gshade to Reshade before, it should be compatible for both Gshade and Reshade.Feel free to use #komishade hashtag on twitter if you use my presets for your screenies.

Adjusting levels and the multiluts will let them be usable in full daytime.If you have yet to move from GSHADE to RESHADE please see this guide if you&#x27;d like to start:https://cryotechnic.github.io/gshade-migration/migration_guide/","PackageType":"Preset","AlternateTitle":null,"PackageAlias":null,"Source":"xivmodarchive.com","Timestamp":"2025-03-27T22:44:08.391+00:00","Skipped":false,"Imported":true,"Published":true,"Tags":null,"URLs":{"IterativeDownload":null,"OriginalDownloadLink":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/97ef02d2-5669-40a2-9274-9a4aeb0b4ed9/files/Fur%20and%20Gold%20by%20KORE.zip","Page":"https://xivmodarchive.com/modid/92666","DirectDownload":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/97ef02d2-5669-40a2-9274-9a4aeb0b4ed9/files/Fur%20and%20Gold%20by%20KORE.zip"}},{"Id":"preset-6e0ba69cb78390544636de84b00648e3ed39f078d9b5299e9cb28426d8fe2d923872f44c49437ca47c23708bf871621596954300ea507b787a78b31dbe02a934","Name":"Umbral Light - By Eden","Author":"snowfallenera","Description":"Custom preset designed to invoke the memories of The First and the Flood of Light.","PackageType":"Preset","AlternateTitle":null,"PackageAlias":null,"Source":"xivmodarchive.com","Timestamp":"2025-03-27T22:44:10.13+00:00","Skipped":false,"Imported":true,"Published":true,"Tags":null,"URLs":{"IterativeDownload":null,"OriginalDownloadLink":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/b68ed050-0485-46a4-980d-986533462f0e/files/Eden%20-%20Umbral%20Light.ini","Page":"https://xivmodarchive.com/modid/45947","DirectDownload":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/b68ed050-0485-46a4-980d-986533462f0e/files/Eden%20-%20Umbral%20Light.ini"}},{"Id":"preset-392ceec4501da056f033481db16dea703005c45ce94756ef987f4900705a27d98105643f40b38c00db8e7e4b26d5576f4e5263a6282c276c5542cd68433fb9bb","Name":"[Day.V] B&amp;W Dark Vision","Author":"Dave Sare","Description":"Gshade Staff → gshade.org/All Credits to the shader createrPreset made from scratch by me.","PackageType":"Preset","AlternateTitle":null,"PackageAlias":null,"Source":"xivmodarchive.com","Timestamp":"2025-03-27T22:44:11.4+00:00","Skipped":false,"Imported":true,"Published":true,"Tags":null,"URLs":{"IterativeDownload":null,"OriginalDownloadLink":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/ccd555c1-0819-44e4-81e1-2718aa21539e/files/%5BDay.V%5D%20B%26W%20Dark%20Vision.rar","Page":"https://xivmodarchive.com/modid/104269","DirectDownload":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/ccd555c1-0819-44e4-81e1-2718aa21539e/files/%5BDay.V%5D%20B%26W%20Dark%20Vision.rar"}},{"Id":"preset-15b0ebb60f118465c67ee0c103c5d8879d1336c60d8faaa0a4174b033a5b03721805c5880fd63faf1ec7db3adde2d654c481282a46d12ea3be1c103d3864dd68","Name":"Eldritch Gameplay - Reshade Preset","Author":"rozmarin","Description":"I recommend using this on performance mode.The goal of this shader was to darken the world a little, adding fog and shadows to give it more of a horror vibe while not being too intensive or distracting.Install to your Reshade-presets folder, preferably under a new folder named &quot;Eldritch&quot; so that you may find it quicker&quot;","PackageType":"Preset","AlternateTitle":null,"PackageAlias":null,"Source":"xivmodarchive.com","Timestamp":"2025-03-27T22:44:12.432+00:00","Skipped":false,"Imported":true,"Published":true,"Tags":null,"URLs":{"IterativeDownload":null,"OriginalDownloadLink":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/fa31621e-bb12-406d-95f1-bce7d39daadb/files/Eldritch%20Gameplay.ini","Page":"https://xivmodarchive.com/modid/68708","DirectDownload":"https://xivmodarchive.com/private/fa31621e-bb12-406d-95f1-bce7d39daadb/files/Eldritch%20Gameplay.ini"}},{"Id":"preset-afe3ed436fd3b3e7ec4745463dd1e5512b6cd23d7004bc66ee486160badfdd7f50252f63166b750c7ffb97ed85fdad92734f3217209e4207bd4130a880778beb","Name":"CatShade","Author":"catrandomnessxiv","Description":"Hello, Cat here, this is my first attempt at making anything like this. It&#x27;s not going to be perfect by any stretch but I liked how it turned out.This preset uses Reshade and optionally uses Immerse Pro RGTI as well as Immerse Ultimate Relight. Both Immerse Pro and Immerse Ultimate can be found by their respective creator at https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg/posts. You do not need these to use the preset at all, but they do give it some more flare.The intended use for this preset is for Gpose. I would not recommend using the ADOF or Immerse Ultimate Relight shaders for regular gameplay.Anyways, thank you for taking the time to check this out. Hope you have a great day. &lt;3Update 5/5/2024 2:29 PM EST: Through some testing, it was discovered that the ADOF settings I had messed with while trying to learn how to do this were causing some unexpected things to happen, so I decided to revert the ADOF to the default settings for it. I hope that this will resolve any of those issues you&#x27;re having. Please redownload, I have reuploaded with an updated preset. Apologies for any inconvenience. &lt;3I do gpose stuff and occasionally post on Twitter as well.

A VARIETY of presets is included for various areas - including a few new semi gameplay ones.I personally don&#x27;t roll gameplay ones because i get lagged anyways even with color ones, but if you can handle it there&#x27;s a couple nice ones in this pack!PLEASE do me a huge favor, and do make comments on how these can improve - I realize they&#x27;re just preset packs, and they&#x27;re just presets - but I&#x27;m shooting for the stars with these and feel like i&#x27;m selling you flashlights. SOME shaders are included, and lisc/credit for those is in the text files included.Not all of the packs have text files included, but just roll with whatever i&#x27;ve written in previous ones.if something&#x27;s not labelled properly blame my ADHD. The packs that require TEXTURE changes there should be instructions on what to rename them to, and credits for the original photography.Please note, while yes I do personally work in AI, i will never bring it into my XIV mods and I will always keep these clean!

A small pack of 4 this time (rip a computer wipe i lost a good majoirty of finsihed stuff but that&#x27;s ok), this mini set has been designed with the beginning A Realm Reborn locations in mind with simple and clear colouring to suit a variety of locations.These have been made in Gshade with both free and paid IMMERSE shaders. If you are having any problems with them in Reshade, please let me know and I will do my best to pinpoint the issue. Original shaders such as MXAO etc have been kept intact as an option for non IMMERSE users.I have included a variety fo different shader toggles! Do experiment with them. All extra effects toggles such ADOF and volumetric fogs have been toggled off to increase loading times, shaders that enhance colours and brightness (colourfulness, technicolour2, blooming HDR etc) can be edited manually as you see fit!These work outdoors, indoors and in the studio at varying times of the day and have been tested on a variety of skintones. Please turn off the ingame DOF and adjust the manual brightness as needed! I heavily encourage adjusting and playing around with the different shader toggles included depending on the mood for your photo!These come with unique textures too, please ensure they are installed in the: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SquareEnix\\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn\\game\\gshade-shaders\\Textures folder to use.If using the latest GSHADE, the path is different to prevent loss with the update; gshade custom shaders &gt; shaders. Same with custom textures; gshade custom shaders &gt; textures. this has been added to the guide for new gshade users.There are also some tips in my MEGA master folder on using StageDepth shaders and installing immerse. If you are on the altest GSHADE, the base, free Immerse is now installed with the program. I will also add this preset pack to the MEGA folder for backup.Presets included are:New Adventurer - Vanillaesque colouring, simple!Limsa Lominsa - A brighter preset with slightly saturated colours with a slight emphasis on blueGridania - A slightly autumnal preset with warm and desaturated huesUldah - A golden toned preset wit the desert sand in mindPlease note you must have immerse installed for Immerse functions, original shader toggles have been kept intact as another option! You can find Immerse here: https://github.com/martymcmodding/iMMERSETo use the Film Grain you will need to download Marty McFly&#x27;s METEOR extra effects shaders (Free): https://github.com/martymcmodding/METEORIf you need ReVeil by Lord of Lunacy, here is the link: https://github.com/LordOfLunacy/Insane-ShadersI have added some keybinds to my presets to easily toggle on and off. All frame texures drawn by myself in Photoshop.Thank you once again! Please enjoy and if there is something amiss or you have a question, do not hesitate to reach out and I&#x27;ll do my best to helpIf you are that way inclined to use hashtags when posting pictures, #Elvashade or #Elvashaders will suffice!

This was designed with the intent to provide a good baseline for indoor photos with lower, more intimate lighting, for instance, the cathedral in Ishgard, as shown in the preview.This preset uses Reshade and optionally uses Immerse Ultimate Relight. Immerse Ultimate can be found by their respective creator at https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg/posts. You do not need this to use the preset at all, but it does give it some more flare.The intended use for this preset is for Gpose. I would not recommend using the ADOF or Immerse Ultimate Relight shaders for regular gameplay.Anyways, thank you for taking the time to check this out. Hope you have a great day. &lt;3I do gpose stuff and occasionally post on Twitter as well.

If you are having any problems with them in Reshade, please let me know and I will do my best to pinpoint the issue.I have made these presets in my garden in the Lavender Beds. I have used RTGI for these previews but no post processing. I recommend using them in other verdant and lush areas in nature, try them anywhere you like! All extra effects toggles such ADOF and volumetric fogs have been toggled off to increase loading times, shaders that enhance colours and brightness (colourfulness, technicolour2) as well so you can edit those as needed manually.These work outdoors, indoors and in the studio at varying times of the day and have been tested on a variety of skintones. Please turn off the ingame DOF and adjust the manual brightness as needed!

This Reshade preset aims to provide a realistic colour palette with darker darks, beautiful sunsets and a fully preserved UI for gameplay.Light-emitting objects have a soft glow around them, visible during low-light situations. Dark areas are nearly pitch-black. This Reshade pack is made with an HDR monitor in mind, however, the screenshots will be representative of how it will look on your screen. A 4K monitor is also recommended due to the sharpening effects working better on high resolutions.Using this preset, FFXIV runs at 105fps at 4k on my RTX 4090.

This set of four high-contrast presets is made with GShade and is customizable &amp; personable to your projects. I emphasize that these are high contrast, so only black and white will come through in the result first, which may require you to edit the colors of your clothing or features and toggle things such as exposure, ambient light, contrast, etc. For darker skin tones on top of the toggles I mentioned, I would recommend upping the pattern shading as well! These are studio-specific presets and have not been tested outside so results may vary. These do not require any external shaders. Fair warning that based on their nature, when you first load the presets it may look crazy, but you just need to adjust the toggles around whatever lighting you’ve chosen! This is my first time uploading presets publicly so if there are any issues please let me know and I will try my best to fix them!

This pack features a diverse collection of ReShade presets designed to enhance your Final Fantasy XIV experience across various areas and moods. You&#x27;ll find options for general visual enhancement, specific zone aesthetics, and even a few experimental gameplay-focused presets.---What&#x27;s Inside:*   Variety is Key: A wide range of presets to suit different environments and player preferences.*   Gameplay Options: While I personally find gameplay-focused ReShades can impact my performance, a couple of carefully crafted options are included for those whose systems can handle the extra load. Your mileage may vary!*   Bonus Content: This release also includes some previously unreleased or &quot;tested-and-forgotten-about&quot; presets, so you&#x27;re getting a little extra this time around!---A Note on Shaders &amp; Textures:*   No Paid Shaders: To the best of my knowledge, all shaders referenced or included are freely available. I do not use paid shaders in these packs.*   Shader Files: Some individual preset folders may contain necessary .fx shader files. Credit and license information for these, where applicable, can usually be found in accompanying text files or in the main repository&#x27;s documentation.*   Missing Shaders? If a preset isn&#x27;t working correctly due to a missing shader, please let me know! I&#x27;ll do my best to point you in the right direction.*   Texture-Based Presets: For presets that utilize custom textures (e.g., for LUTs or specific depth effects), instructions on texture placement, any necessary renaming, and credits for original photography (if applicable) should be included within that preset&#x27;s notes or associated files.*   Remix &amp; Reuse: Feel free to mix, match, and modify these presets to your heart&#x27;s content.---A Quick Word on AI:While I do explore AI tools in other creative projects, I am committed to keeping these FFXIV mods free of AI-generated assets. You can expect handcrafted quality here – no uncanny valley adventurers with questionable anatomy!---Your Feedback is Gold!I&#x27;m always striving to improve these presets. While they might seem like simple adjustments, I&#x27;m aiming high! Please don&#x27;t hesitate to share your thoughts, suggestions, or any issues you encounter. Constructive criticism helps me make them better for everyone.---Special Thanks:A huge shout-out to my Gpose partners, Angel Of&#x27;the&#x27;night &amp; Azem Soulcleaver, for frequently (and often unknowingly) becoming the stars of my preset showcases. Your characters help bring these visuals to life!---Connect &amp; Support:If you enjoy these presets and want to see more, consider checking out my socials or supporting my work.
